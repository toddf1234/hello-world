{"name":"Hello-world","tagline":"A GItHub repository I use for playing around with GitHub.","body":"### Welcome to the Web Page for my Hello-World on GitHub Pages.\r\nThis used GitHub's automatic page generator. Initial page content was authored using GitHub Flavored Markdown. You can check out the new branch as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nI used one of the pre-defined templates provided by GitHub. After publishing, you can easily revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. The Page content is preserved if it remained in markdown format.\r\n\r\n### You can also do all this manually...\r\nJust push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
